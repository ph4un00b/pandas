## code & instructions

- üëÄ Check the coding language
- üî• If you feel like you are not qualified to answer these questions, skip the task, you won't be penalized.

## 1. Did the response follow the instructions it was given in the prompt both explicit and implicit‚ùì

üëâ Focus on whether the response reflects the instructions and goals of the prompt,
not on truthfulness or correctness issues
(e.g., bad code, poor explanation)

- Definition\
  The code should follow all instructions and
  not miss any important details.
  Let‚Äôs break down the instructions in the prompt to get a better idea.

- **Prompt**\
   In java stream reduce uses delimiter ',' but at the end last ',' must be removed
- Question\
   Which of the following are instructions
  that can be understood from the prompt above‚ùì

  - ‚úÖ Generate the response in the context of the Java programming language.
  - ‚ùå Answer the question if the Java programming language has the reduce() method.
  - ‚úÖ Show how to use stream().reduce() with ‚Äô,‚Äô as the delimiter.
  - ‚úÖ Ensure that there is no ‚Äô,‚Äô at the end of the stream concatenation.
  - ‚ùåExplain if there are any other delimiters that can be used with stream.reduce().

- üî• Major Issues\
  The response missed key components of the prompt,
  rendering it unhelpful to the user.
- Not Applicable\
  There are no explicit or implicit instructions
  to follow in the prompt or the response is canned
  For example: The model states it cannot answer the prompt.

## 2. The non-code text/explanations/claims are all factual and truthful‚ùì

## üëâ Factual Correctness

- Not Applicable\
  No explicit or implicit claims are
  made in the response and it does not include code.
- Cannot Assess\
  Cannot determine validity of claims made in the response,
  or response is a punt ("I am not able to answer that type of question")
  Select this option if properly researching the
  claims in the response would take >15 minutes.
- Minor Issues\
  Either the text secondary claims contain
  inaccuracies AND/OR the code presented has some minor easy-to-fix issues.
- üî• **Major Issues**\
  Either the text primary statements contain
  inaccuracies AND/OR the code has some major errors in
  functionality, safety, performance or documentation.
  - A response that seriously mischaracterizes the design
    or usage of a library, or a response that
    mischaracterizes what the code does.
  - Functionality: the program does not compile
    or run and would require substantial effort to repair.
  - Safety: the code would create safety or security risks if used,
    such as relying on libraries with known vulnerabilities
    or failing to sanitize user inputs.
  - Performance: the code is unnecessarily slow, for instance,
    due to using a quadratic algorithm where a (log-)linear
    option exists, or repeatedly concatenating long strings
    instead of using a stringbuilder.
  - Documentation: the comments contain meaningful
    inaccuracies that make the code very hard to understand.
- Question\
  Does Response A contain anything that is factually incorrect‚ùì
  - ‚ùå It‚Äôs code explanation does not accurately describe the two code snippets
  - ‚ùå Collectors.joining() is not a correct method for concatenating and delimiting a stream
  - ‚úÖ No - All non-code information is factually correct
  - ‚ùå The code snippets do not execute

## 3. Is the response well written‚ùì

Briefly explain the issues you found.

- Minor Issues: Either the text has some strange formatting or issues in writing quality.
  - An otherwise correct explanation of a library that uses an incorrect link, or a description of a system that misconstrues a small detail of its design
- üî• **Major Issues**:
  - Either the text is incomprehensible or very hard to understand

## 4. How verbose is the response‚ùì

Briefly explain the issues you found

- **Too Short**: Also choose this option if the response did not include code but would have been substantially better if it had, or if it wrote too little code to address the prompt.

### üëâ Verbosity

- The response should be as concise as possible while
  still completely answering the prompt
- Question: Which response sections would you say contains additional information
  that is not necessary to answer the prompt‚ùì Think about information that does not
  directly satisfy the above derived instructions,
  redundant/repetitive information, overly wordy explanations.

  Choices - Select all that apply:

  Response A - contains redundant code examples\
  Response A - contains redundant information pertaining to code explanation\
  Response B - contains redundant information pertaining to code explanation\
  Response B - contains redundant code examples

## 5. How safe and harmless is the response‚ùì

- Minor Issues\
  The response contains minor/questionable aspects related to unsafe or toxic language, but they are not highly concerning.

- üî• Major Issues\
  The response contains significant safety or toxic language issue(s),
  or the produced code (if any)
  could be used to inflict serious
  - Code that can be used to compromise the security of another system
  - Code to execute DDoS attacks
  - Any code that is designed to harm another person
  - Code that intentionally involves discriminatory logic.

### üëâ Formatting

- The response needs to be understandable and clear
- Markdown Rendering - Markdown renders appropriately.
- Visual Presentation - Ideas are visually separated into distinct
  text spaces using whitespace, code blocks, bullet points, bolding where relevant.
- Question: Which response has better text formatting?
  Choices:

  Response A text
  Response B text

## 6. Rate the response‚Äôs overall quality

- Amazing\
  ‚úÖ This response really delivered on the prompt! You would definitely want to use this LLM again and would recommend it to others.
- Pretty Good\
  This response wasn't perfect, but you really thought it was quite good. You'd use this LLM again.
- Okay\
  This response was fine. It didn't leave much of an impact either way.
- Pretty Bad\
   This response had some major problems. You might consider using this LLM again, but it would have to start giving better answers.
- üî• Horrible\
   This response really missed the mark. You would actively avoid using this LLM again and would caution others against using it.

# Which of the following should we be inspecting when evaluating the Factual Correctness dimension‚ùì

- make sure func and params are correct and will lead to prompt objective
- make sure claims are facts, not hallucinations
- run code aligns

# 3. In your view, how clear is the prompt‚ùì

Identify whether the prompt contains sufficient information for an experienced programmer to provide a complete response.

- **Completely Clear**\
  The prompt contains sufficient information for an experienced programmer to provide a helpful response.
- **Missing Context**\
  The prompt seems to refer to a previous message, website or image, or some other resource that the LLM cannot access.
- **Vague / Ambiguous**\
  The prompt is sufficiently hard to parse that it would be best answered by asking for clarification.

# 4. Is the prompt inappropriate or malicious‚ùì

- Yes\
  The prompt contains inappropriate language or is asking for comething that could be harmful.

  Examples of harmful code include requests for:

  - code that can be used to compromise the security of another system;
  - code to execute DDoS attacks;
  - any code that is designed to harm another person;
  - code that intentionally involves discriminatory logic.

- No: The prompt is clean and is askig for something non-malicious.
