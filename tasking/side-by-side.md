_Response X is better than Response Y because it is correct._\
This is considered **spamming üî•** and will be detected and penalized by our experts.

## 2. How confident do you feel about your responses‚ùì

- **Low**\
  I do not understand the perspective of the user, or I am not sure what they are asking about. I don't have confidence the rating I've given is accurate.
  - üî• If you feel like you are not qualified to answer this task correctly, skip it, you will not be penalized
- **Medium**\
  I understand mostly what the user is looking for. I am fairly sure I've given a fair rating.
- **High**\
  I am certain I understand what the user is looking for, and I am familiar enough with the topic to be certain I've given a correct rating.

## examples‚ùó‚ùó

- I prefer response A because it follows the prompt better than response B with using `stream().reduce()`
  for concatenating the stream with a delimiter and not having a trailing comma.
  Even though response A‚Äôs code has syntax errors, the logic is correct for doing what the prompt asked for.
  Response B has a major issue of saying that the functionality described
  in the prompt is not possible with stream().reduce().

- (verbose) Response A is overly verbose because it adds many sections that are not needed to answer the prompt.
  In the first sentence, it already describes why the syntax doesn't work but then dedicates an
  entire section to explain again why it does not work.
  It also populates the response with too many examples.
  Response B is much more concise in answering the prompt correctly
  and does not have unnecessary sections.

- (verbose) Response A is too verbose because of the unnecessary redundant sections.
  It already explains string formatting and alignment at the beginning and then explains
  it again when breaking down the code that it has generated.
  It also has an important notes section that is not necessary.
  Response B does not have redundant explanations and answers the prompt very concisely.
