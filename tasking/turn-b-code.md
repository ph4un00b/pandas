## code & execution

- Code Execution Correctness

  - The code should **execute** without errors‚ùó
  - Question: Is there anything wrong with this code that
    will prevent it from executing?
    Choices:
    No - The code will execute.
    ‚ùå - The code does not have a class or main method
    ‚ùå - Collectors.joining() is not implemented correctly

- Code **Output** Correctness

  - The code needs to produce the correct **output**
  - Question: We already know that Response A‚Äôs code does not work,
    but syntax errors aside, are they logically correct‚ùì
    Choices:
    Yes
    No

- üëâ Factual Correctness

  - The non-code text/explanations/claims
    are all factual and truthful‚ùì
  - Keep in mind that the code may be functional for the prompter,
    even if it does not compile or run on your setup.
    - a response that points to a file only accessible to the prompter,
    - provides a partial program based on the context provided by the prompter
    - ‚ùå unless it contains errors that would (likely) manifest in the prompter‚Äôs programming context.

- Is the response well written‚ùì
  Briefly explain the issues you found.

  - Minor Issues:

    - A code has minor problems that are straightforward to fix (e.g., missing imports, small syntax errors), or is correct but has misleading comments.

  - üî• Major Issues:
    - the code is very hard to follow or is missing critical documentation.

- üëâ Verbosity

  - Question: Which response sections would you say contains additional information
    that is not necessary to answer the prompt‚ùì
    Choices - Select all that apply:
    Response A - contains redundant code examples
    Response A - contains redundant information pertaining to code explanation
    Response B - contains redundant information pertaining to code explanation
    Response B - contains redundant code examples

- üëâ Clean Code

  - Formatting - Perfect formatting that is neat and utilizes white-space effectively.
  - Naming - Variables and function names that make the understanding of code easier.
  - Code Design - Code is nicely de-composed and divided in functions
    that are intelligible and that make sense.
  - Question: Which response‚Äôs code is more readable‚ùì
    Choices:

    Response A code
    Response B code

- truthful & correct‚ùì
  - üëâ code execution & code output & factual correctness
  - major issues:
    - a severely false claim about the stream().reduce() method.

# bad answers

## Instruction Following

- Prompt:

input_string=input("enter a string:")
no_spaces_string=input_string.replace(" "," ")
string_length=len(no_spaces_string)
print("length of the string(after removing spaces):",string_length)

```
  if code_prompt contains Error
    return CODE MODIFICATION
  else
    return CODE UNDERSTANDING

  return BAD CONTEXT
```

## Factual Correctness:

- Prompt:

What is a set enumeration tree.

Imagine you have a set \( S = \{a, b, c\} \). The set enumeration tree for \( S \) represents all possible subsets of \( S \), including the empty set and the set itself.

Here's a simple representation of the set enumeration tree for \( S \):

```

                 {}

               / | \

              /  |  \

             a   b   c

            / \  |  / \

           b   c c   b a

          /     |     \

         c      a      a

```

## Code Output Correctness

- Prompt:

Single File Programming Question

Problem Statement

You have been assigned the task of designing a program that converts a given sentence into reverse order, extracts the vowels and consonants from the sentence, and prints them separately.

Input 1 :
Hello, world!

Output 1 :
world! Hello,
eoo
Hllwrld
in c++

```output
Reversed sentence: ,olleH dlrow
Vowels: eoo
Consonants: Hllwrld
```

## Verbosity

- Prompt:
  Write a c program to display all the letters of the alphabet (a-z). Use two for loops: the 1st one will print all
  letters in small letters and the 2nd one will print them in capital letters.
  Example output:
  a b c d e‚Ä¶z
  A B C D E‚Ä¶Z

```

## both correct

- Response A: correct
  Response B: correct
  Action: see Step 3
- Response A: incorrect
  Response B: incorrect
  Action: see Step 3
- Step 3: Choose the more concise response between the two.
  This means you must choose the one that is shorter,
  when they are both incorrect or they are both correct.
